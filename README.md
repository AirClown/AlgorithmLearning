# AlgorithmLearning
This is my learning record.

used c++

include:

1.A* algorithm

2.Merging sort

3.Dijkstra algorithm

4.Gobang(low AI,used easyx.h)

5.Cube(show 3D cube in 2D,used easyx.h)

6.KMP algorithm(simple and so beautiful,just let me feel like a fool,I think everyone shoud learn it)

7.BinaryTree(deletTree is hard for me,I need more prictice.PS,Reverse BinaryTree,so easy...)

8.Prim Algorithm(find smallest tree)

9.BellmanFord Algorithm

10.Floyd-warshall Algorithm

11.Eight Queens

12.Joseph Problem(good problem!)

13.AVL Tree(more complex than Binary Tree)

continue learning......
